🛠️ Blockchain-Based Certificate Generation & Validation System

🔗 Overview:
A decentralized platform for issuing, storing, and verifying digital certificates using blockchain technology. This system ensures security, transparency, and fraud prevention by leveraging smart contracts and cryptographic hashing.
✨ Features:

✅ Tamper-Proof Certificates – Immutable records stored on the blockchain.
✅ Decentralized Verification – No third-party dependency for validation.
✅ Smart Contract-Powered – Automated issuance & validation.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Web-based portal for easy access.
✅ Cost-Effective & Secure – Eliminates certificate forgery & paperwork.
🚀 Tech Stack:

    Blockchain: Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric

    Smart Contracts: Solidity

    Backend: Node.js / Python

    Frontend: React.js / Vue.js

    Database: IPFS / MongoDB

📌 How It Works:

1️⃣ Institution Issues a certificate via smart contract.
2️⃣ Certificate is Stored on the blockchain (hash stored, metadata off-chain).
3️⃣ Anyone Can Verify by querying the blockchain.
